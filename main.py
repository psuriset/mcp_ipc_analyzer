As an expert Linux Systems Analyst, your task is to analyze a snapshot of processes and their network connections from a RHEL 8 system to identify Inter-Process Communication (IPC) patterns.

Here is the snapshot of processes with active or listening network connections:
--- PROCESS CONNECTION SNAPSHOT ---
{json.dumps(process_connections, indent=2)}
--- END PROCESS CONNECTION SNAPSHOT ---

Based on the data provided, perform the following analysis:
1.  **Identify Key Services:** List the processes that are acting as servers (i.e., in a 'LISTEN' state). What services are they providing based on their port and process name?
2.  **Identify Key Clients:** List the processes that have established outbound connections. What external services are they communicating with?
3.  **Provide a High-Level Summary:** Write a brief summary of the system's role based on this snapshot. Is it primarily a web server, a database server, a client machine, or a mix of roles?

Present your analysis in a clear, structured format.
